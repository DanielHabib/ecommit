# ecommit
Ecommit Generates a random emoji and appends it to your commit message.
Bring your repo to life

## Setup
Put an alias in your bash profile

## Next
 * Going to create a menu that raises a prompt, the prompt will give you options to categorize your commit and it will append a specific emoji to it. This will help categorize commits at a glance.

  * Ex. If you are commiting a bug you will get the emoji :bug: appended to your message
 * Hook up `emojis.txt` for offline commiting  


## Dependencies
I wrote it on OSX, so currently you need gshuf, python3.5 and jq

## Reasons to use this
Artistic Expression
